          <p>Keystone was newly developed, and while the atomic core layer was established first, a significant gap emerged between the new core library and the existing legacy system.</p>

          <p>Core Library (Tier 1) is a high-quality, centrally governed set of atomic and foundational components used across all platforms. Platform Libraries (Tier 2) is composite components built from core primitives, tailored for the unique needs of each product platform.</p>

            <h3>Collaboration working model</h3>
            <p>The collaboration model shows how the product design and design system teams work in tandem from kick-off to release. Product designers identify needs and request components, while the design system team evaluates these requests, understands product scenarios, and defines the supporting patterns. The two teams align at key checkpoints, such as reviews and adoption testing. After finalizing documentation and supporting engineering implementation through design QA, the design system team hands off the implemented components to product engineers. As the product design team proceeds with product design QA, the design system team refines documentation and publishes updates to the Figma library. </p>

            <li>Developed 30 TikTok Ad manager platform components, and Achieved 27K Figma insertions, demonstrating strong adoption and measurable improvement in design quality in 2025.</li>
            <li>Consolidated 6 redundant local video tile designs into a single unified video tile, achieving an 83% reduction in duplicated design work. Leveraged a single core asset tile with custom slot variants to support 20 video-tile variants, eliminating the need to create 20 separate components. This approach drove a 95% reduction in variant duplication, strengthening design consistency, reducing waste, and significantly improving reusability across teams.</li>
